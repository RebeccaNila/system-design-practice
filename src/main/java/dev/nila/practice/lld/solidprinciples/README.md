# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help in creating more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows adding new functionality without altering existing code.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It encourages smaller, more specific interfaces.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

By adhering to these principles, developers can create code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
