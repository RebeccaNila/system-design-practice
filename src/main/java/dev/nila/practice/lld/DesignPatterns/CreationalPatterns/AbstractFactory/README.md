# 🍽️ Abstract Factory Design Pattern - Meal Ordering System

## 🧠 Definition

**Abstract Factory Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

In simple terms, it's like a **factory of factories** – allowing you to create **entire product families** (like a meal combo with a main item and a side item) consistently, while keeping the creation logic flexible and extensible.
